abstract: Visual scene recognition is a proactive process through which contextual
  cues and top-down expectations facilitate the extraction of invariant features.
  Whether the emotional content of the scenes exerts a reliable influence on these
  processes or not, however, remains an open question. Here, topographic ERP mapping
  analysis and a distributed source localization method were used to characterize
  the electrophysiological correlates of proactive processes leading to scene recognition,
  as well as the potential modulation of these processes by memory and emotion. On
  each trial, the content of a complex neutral or emotional scene was progressively
  revealed, and participants were asked to decide whether this scene had previously
  been encountered or not (delayed match-to-sample task). Behavioral results showed
  earlier recognition for old compared to new scenes, as well as delayed recognition
  for emotional vs. neutral scenes. Electrophysiological results revealed that, ~
  400 ms following stimulus onset, activity in ventral object-selective regions increased
  linearly as a function of accumulation of perceptual evidence prior to recognition
  of old scenes. The emotional content of the scenes had an early influence in these
  areas. By comparison, at the same latency, the processing of new scenes was mostly
  achieved by dorsal and medial frontal brain areas, including the anterior cingulate
  cortex and the insula. In the latter region, emotion biased recognition at later
  stages, likely corresponding to decision making processes. These findings suggest
  that emotion can operate at distinct and multiple levels during proactive processes
  leading to scene recognition, depending on the extent of prior encounter with these
  scenes.
