abstract: The rapid extraction of affective cues from the visual environment is crucial
  for flexible behavior. Previous studies have reported emotion-dependent amplitude
  modulations of two event-related potential (ERP) components - the N1 and EPN - reflecting
  sensory gain control mechanisms in extrastriate visual areas. However, it is unclear
  whether both components are selective electrophysiological markers of attentional
  orienting toward emotional material or are also influenced by physical features
  of the visual stimuli. To address this question, electrical brain activity was recorded
  from seventeen male participants while viewing original and bright versions of neutral
  and erotic pictures. Bright neutral scenes were rated as more pleasant compared
  to their original counterpart, whereas erotic scenes were judged more positively
  when presented in their original version. Classical and mass univariate ERP analysis
  showed larger N1 amplitude for original relative to bright erotic pictures, with
  no differences for original and bright neutral scenes. Conversely, the EPN was only
  modulated by picture content and not by brightness, substantiating the idea that
  this component is a unique electrophysiological marker of attention allocation toward
  emotional material. Complementary topographic analysis revealed the early selective
  expression of a centro-parietal positivity following the presentation of original
  erotic scenes only, reflecting the recruitment of neural networks associated with
  sustained attention and facilitated memory encoding for motivationally relevant
  material. Overall, these results indicate that neural networks subtending the extraction
  of emotional information are differentially recruited depending on low-level perceptual
  features, which ultimately influence affective evaluations.
