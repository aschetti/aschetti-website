abstract: Processing affectively charged visual stimuli typically results in increased
  amplitude of specific event-related potential (ERP) components. Low-level features
  similarly modulate electrophysiological responses, with amplitude changes proportional
  to variations in stimulus size and contrast. However, it remains unclear whether
  emotion-related amplifications during visual word processing are necessarily intertwined
  with changes in specific low-level features or, instead, may act independently.
  In this pre-registered electrophysiological study, we varied font size and contrast
  of neutral and negative words while participants were monitoring their semantic
  content. We examined ERP responses associated with early sensory and attentional
  processes as well as later stages of stimulus processing. Results showed amplitude
  modulations by low-level visual features early on following stimulus onset – i.e.,
  P1 and N1 components –, while the LPP was independently modulated by these visual
  features. Independent effects of size and emotion were observed only at the level
  of the EPN. Here, larger EPN amplitudes for negative were observed only for small
  high contrast and large low contrast words. These results suggest that early increase
  in sensory processing at the EPN level for negative words is not automatic, but
  bound to specific combinations of low-level features, occurring presumably via attentional
  control processes.
