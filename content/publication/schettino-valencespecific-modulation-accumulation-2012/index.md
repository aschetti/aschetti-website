abstract: Visual scene recognition is a dynamic process through which incoming sensory
  information is iteratively compared with predictions regarding the most likely identity
  of the input stimulus. In this study, we used a novel progressive unfolding task
  to characterize the accumulation of perceptual evidence prior to scene recognition,
  and its potential modulation by the emotional valence of these scenes. Our results
  show that emotional (pleasant and unpleasant) scenes led to slower accumulation
  of evidence compared to neutral scenes. In addition, when controlling for the potential
  contribution of non-emotional factors (i.e., familiarity and complexity of the pictures),
  our results confirm a reliable shift in the accumulation of evidence for pleasant
  relative to neutral and unpleasant scenes, suggesting a valence-specific effect.
  These findings indicate that proactive iterations between sensory processing and
  top-down predictions during scene recognition are reliably influenced by the rapidly
  extracted (positive) emotional valence of the visual stimuli. We interpret these
  findings in accordance with the notion of a genuine positivity offset during emotional
  scene recognition.
