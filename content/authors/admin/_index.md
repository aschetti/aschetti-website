I have a background in experimental psychology, cognitive and affective electrophysiology. As an independent researcher, I investigate the relationship between emotions and visual perception using a wide range of methodological and statistical tools. I adopt transparent and open science practices at every stage of the research cycle, from the preregistration of the initial idea to manuscript publication.

As Senior Advisor Open Science at Erasmus Research Services (Erasmus University Rotterdam), my tasks include: developing educational and training materials for students, researchers, and support staff; advising researchers, research teams, and grant officers on how to best highlight commitment to open science in grant applications; advising management and policy makers on current and future (inter)national trends related to evaluation procedures at the individual and institutional level.
