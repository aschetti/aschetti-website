<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>In this blog post I will engage in something a bit more serious than playing with <a href="/post/2017-11-19-attractive-attractor/">static</a> or <a href="/post/2017-12-09-happy-holidays/">dynamic</a> images (although, admittedly, it’s a lot of fun). I will show you my first attempt at analyzing a document using the wonderful <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/index.html"><code>tidytext</code></a> package.</p>
<p><code>tidytext</code> allows to sort the constituent elements of a text (e.g., single words or <em>n</em>-grams) following Hadley Wickham’s <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">tidy principles</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>each variable is a column;</li>
<li>each observation is a row;</li>
<li>each type of observational unit is a table.</li>
</ul>
<p>It then becomes quite easy to extrapolate word frequencies (how often they occur) and word correlations (do specific words follow each other?), run sentiment analysis (overall positive/negative emotional connotation of the text), and topic modeling (i.e., identify words associated with a pre-specified number of overarching topics). All this can be done in a single document, across the body of work of an author, or large heterogeneous datasets (e.g., tweets).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-book" class="section level1">
<h1>The book</h1>
<p>For this exercise, I decided to explore <strong>Wuthering Heights</strong> by <em>Emily Brontë</em>. When I read it (a long, long time ago), I was not particularly hit by the troubled love between Heathcliff and Catherine – although I was definitely attracted by the uncontainable, raw, and primordial vortex of passion that pervaded their relationship –, but rather by Heathcliff’s quest for revenge against the upper class, especially embodied by Hindley and Edgar.</p>
<p>Besides my appreciation for the novel, the choice of analyzing <strong>Wuthering Heights</strong> also came from practical considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is available for free from the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/768/768-h/768-h.htm">Project Gutenberg</a> collection, because copyright has expired;</li>
<li>the full text can easily be downloaded with the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gutenbergr/index.html"><code>gutenbergr</code></a> package;</li>
<li>I could find several websites<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that refreshed my memory with respect to the main characters and events of the novel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the instructions in Julia Silge and David Robinson’s fantastic book <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html">Text Mining with R</a>, I was able to download the text, separate it into individual words, and eliminate stop words (e.g., “the”, “of”, “to”) which are not informative. Then I decided to extract <strong>word frequency</strong>, perform <strong>sentiment analysis</strong>, and <strong>topic modeling</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="word-frequency" class="section level1">
<h1>Word frequency</h1>
<p>The first step was to quantify how often words were used across the 34 chapters of the novel, to have an initial idea of the content. So, I counted the number of occurrences for each word and selected only the most common ones (i.e., occurring at least 100 times).</p>
<p><img src="word_frequency.png" /></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the name of the protagonist is the most frequent word in the novel, with 421 occurrences. The name of the co-star also pops up: <em>Catherine Earnshaw</em> (336 occurrences). It’s quite interesting to see the word <em>Linton</em> (346 occurrences) between <em>Heathcliff</em> and <em>Catherine</em>: the two protagonists passionately love each other, but Catherine is seduced by the elegant manners of the Lintons and decides to marry <em>Edgar</em> (114 occurrences).<br />
<em>Master</em> is another frequent word… why? Well, Heathcliff marries <em>Isabella Linton</em>, a calculated act of revenge that allows him to become the legal owner of Thrushcross Grange. Later, he forces <em>Cathy</em> (Catherine and Edgar’s daughter; 130 occurrences) and <em>Linton</em> (Heathcliff and Isabella’s son)<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> to get married, thus becoming Cathy’s father-in-law. When Edgar dies, Heathcliff becomes the master of Wuthering Heights.</p>
</div>
<div id="sentiment-analysis" class="section level1">
<h1>Sentiment analysis</h1>
<p>This novel is dark. No wonder that it was received with mixed reviews when its first edition was published in 1847. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights">Wikipedia</a> page on Wuthering Heights quotes a passage from a review originally published on <em>Graham’s Lady Magazine</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery. It is a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This spicy quote obviously urged me to explore what kind of emotions are conveyed by this devilish work of moral corruption. I extracted sentiment classifications from the <a href="http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon</a> and selected four emotions: <strong>anger</strong>, <strong>fear</strong>, <strong>joy</strong>, and <strong>sadness</strong>.<br />
Here are the 10 most frequent words in each emotion class:</p>
<p><img src="sentiment_analysis.png" /></p>
<p>Indeed, tragedy seems to be omnipresent in the life of these characters. <em>Ill</em> occurs 1 times, <em>death</em> 46 times: Catherine Earnshaw “becomes ill” when emotionally upset (which happens fairly often) and dies right after giving birth to Cathy; Linton is a sickly boy; Edgar’s physical states rapidly deteriorates, until the Grim Reaper finally claims his soul<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The terror of physical ailments is palpable throughout the novel, and quite reasonably given the numerous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diseases_and_epidemics_of_the_19th_century">diseases</a> spreading throughout Europe in the 19th century (cholera, typhus, smallpox, …).<br />
We can also see words considered emotionally negative but actually used in neutral ways in the novel: for instance, <em>fire</em> is categorized as conveying fear in the NRC lexicon, but Emily Brontë mostly uses it to indicate a cooking fire, a cosy fireplace, or candle light. A funny misattribution is also evident with the word <em>mistress</em>, obviously used as a form of courtesy in Wuthering Heights but rated as conveying anger in the NRC lexicon because… because… because BDSM? No idea.<br />
Finally, the word <em>love</em> occurs 2 times. The NRC lexicon classifies it as a joyful word but I wouldn’t be so sure in this case.</p>
<p>Just for fun, I also made a word cloud with the top 50 words categorized as positive or negative according to the lexicon by <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html">Bing Liu and collaborators</a>.</p>
<p><img src="wordcloud.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="topic-modeling" class="section level1">
<h1>Topic modeling</h1>
<p>Finally, I used <a href="http://videolectures.net/mlss09uk_blei_tm/">Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)</a>, a popular unsupervised Bayesian classification method, to divide the terms into 2 sections, hoping to somehow pick up the different events occurring during Heathcliff’s childhood as opposed to his later years.</p>
<p><img src="WH_LDA_topics.png" /></p>
<p><em>Heathcliff</em>, <em>Catherine</em>, and the <em>Lintons</em> (especially <em>Edgar</em>) are the major characters in this book, so it’s obvious to find their names in both topics. The <em>Earnshaw</em> family seems to be more frequent in the first topic, which makes sense. In particular, the role of Mr. Earnshaw is pivotal: he is the one who travels to Liverpool, finds and adopts the orphan Heathcliff, and brings him to Wuthering Heights.<br />
Besides characters’ names, some words seem to be more probable in one topic compared to the other. For example, <em>master</em> is more common in topic 2, because Heathcliff becomes the master of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange later on in the novel.<br />
So, the LDA algorithm might have picked up the intended subdivision, although it may work much more efficiently when subdividing several documents into topics (because of the larger amount of data).</p>
<p>Alright, this was a long post but I had a lot of fun exploring this classical English novel. There are so many other amazing things that you can do with <code>tidytext</code>… if you’re curious, check out <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html">Text Mining with R</a>!</p>
