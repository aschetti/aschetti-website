<p>In this blog post you will find the slides that accompany my presentation at <a href="https://bayesat.github.io/lund2018/bayes_at_lund_2018.html">Bayes@Lund2018</a> (April 12th, 2018, Lund, Sweden).</p>
<p>This is my first slide deck completely created in RStudio with the fantastic package <a href="https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1"><code>xaringan</code></a>, created by <a href="https://github.com/yihui">Yihui Xie</a>. Hopefully I will not sound arrogant if I say that I am quite pleased with it. I spent a long time fiddling with the <em>.css</em> files in order to create a template containing the mandatory logos of <a href="https://www.ugent.be/en">Ghent University</a> and the <a href="https://www.ugent.be/pp/en">Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences</a>. It may not match any of the <a href="https://styleguide.ugent.be/templates/digital.html#presentation-slides">official templates</a>, but it is simple and uncluttered while displaying all the necessary information.</p>
<p>If you browse my website, you will notice that this is also the first time that I embed slides in a blog post. It was not difficult, thanks to the clear instructions in the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown book</a>. I also got inspiration from the source code of <a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/r-ladies-slides/">this blog post</a> by Alison Presmanes Hill. Thanks to all these authors for making my life considerably easier!</p>
<p>Without further ado, here are the slides. The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/aschetti/Bayes-Lund-2018">GitHub</a>. If something is unclear, I could also publish a draft of the speech given during each slide, similarly to what I do when creating presentations in PowerPoint (see examples <a href="https://osf.io/6kny7/">here</a>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
