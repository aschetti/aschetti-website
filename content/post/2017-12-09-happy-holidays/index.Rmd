In my first post I broke the ice by drawing mesmerizing [Clifford attractors](/post/2017-11-19-attractive-attractor/). My second post was supposed to be slightly more serious (e.g., something about data analysis, or what I think about the recent [alpha wars](http://sometimesimwrong.typepad.com/wrong/2017/07/alpha-wars.html)), but I have not yet had the time... and my crippling perfectionism is surely not helping.   
   
So, what better way to procrastinate than to play with two of my favorite things in the world, **R** and our cat **Borre**[^1]?   
   
I set out to create a silly image that is probably going to haunt me in my future job interviews[^2]. The initial inspiration came from a picture that my partner Inez[^3] modified for a gift we recently contributed to (yes, Lien, I'm talking about you):

![***Figure 1.*** *A Borre floating in the void. He has a flat face.*](borre.png)

The holidays are approaching, so we thought of adding a small Christmas hat on that big head (our very own [Yule cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_Cat)):

![***Figure 2.*** *Born for this look.*](yule_borre.png)

A simple white background was not enough. We needed something more appropriate for this period of the year... ah, yes! Snow!   
   
In a recent tweet, [Ilya Kashnitsky](https://twitter.com/ikashnitsky) showed how to create static snow flakes on a dark background. 

**EDIT 2025-01-26**: In the original post, I could link directly to the tweet. However, due to Elon Musk's [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) of the platform, the tweet or the whole account might have been deleted. I cannot verify because I am no longer on Twitter.

```{r tweet_Kashnitsky, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '937786580231696384')

```

I slightly modified the code to have more snow flakes but, more importantly, I animated the plot using [```gganimate```](https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate):

![***Figure 3.*** *Dynamic snow.*](snow.gif)

Finally, I used [```magick```](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/index.html) to blur Borre's face (to make it even more ethereal) and overlay it on the animated snow:

![***Figure 4.*** *Our flat-faced Yule cat in the snow.*](snow_borre.gif)

The end result is a big flat face fluctuating in the air, like a spooky and ominous reminder of our mortality even in these days of opulence.

## EDIT December 19th, 2017

[Paul van der Laken](https://paulvanderlaken.com/) just posted a much better version of the animated snow flakes. 

**EDIT 2025-01-26**: Same as above: in the original post, I could link directly to the tweet, but now it is no longer available.

```{r tweet_van_der_Laken, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}

blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '943052409043062784')

```

I only want the best for my furry boy and his floating flat face, so I modified my initial script and added van der Laken's snow. Here is the result:

![***Figure 5.*** *Our flat-faced Yule cat in much better animated snow.*](better_snow_borre.gif)

Excitement!

Below you will find the code to reproduce this silly festive figure... try with a picture of your own (or somebody else's) favorite pet!

[^1]: Borre, a.k.a. Borremans De Struise, is a lovable and popular chap. For a while, he even had an Instagram account, but he decided to delete it due to privacy concerns.
[^2]: Yeah, I like living on the edge.
[^3]: Besides being quite good with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (see [here](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10214720300938055&set=a.1592053558148.2090722.1140170478&type=3&theater) for one of her silly creations), Inez is a very, very good artist: you can follow her on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/olievlek/), visit her [website](https://inezmgreven.wixsite.com/olievlek), and buy her drawings & paintings on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/inezolievlek).
