I met Jon on March 21st 2019. He was a guest speaker at the [open science symposium](https://users.ugent.be/~fvrbrugg/oss/) to celebrate Brian Nosek's honorary doctorate at Gent University. In his lecture[^1], he mentioned the [principles of open scholarship](https://www.slideshare.net/OpenAIRE_eu/peer-review-in-the-age-of-open-science) by [Tony Ross-Hellauer](https://tonyr-h.github.io/) and said (paraphrased):

> If you look at the foundational principles of open science -- Freedom, Fairness, Justice, Truth, Liberty -- and you are still not doing it, then you are not a good human being."

I found that too confrontational, even counterproductive when the overarching mission is to motivate skeptic people to adopt open science practices. 

But it was powerful, unambiguous, impossible to ignore. The audience *had* to think about his words, face the contradiction, (try to) resolve the tension. Presumably, that was his intent all along: he would not allow you to forget his message. As a consequence, it is difficult to forget him.

I met Jon, but did not *know* him. And yet, I feel compelled to remember him: a complex human being, [painfully open about his struggles](http://fossilsandshit.com/two-stories-of-sexual-assault/), translating adversity into [an opportunity to grow](http://fossilsandshit.com/converting-adversity-into-productivity/), [sporting badass tattoos](http://fossilsandshit.com/a-new-tattoo-a-new-chapter-in-life/). Learning about his sudden demise made me feel the same way as when I learned about [Aaron Swartz](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/04/boy-who-could-change-the-world-review-aaron-schwartz) and his untimely death. Just like Aaron, Jon could have done so much more, *taught* us much more.... fought with us a little bit longer.

We lost a strong leader, a powerful ally in the fight for what is right. 

I did not know Jon, but I will miss him.
